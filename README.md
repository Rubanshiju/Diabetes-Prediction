🩺 Diabetes Prediction - Machine Learning Project

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic health measurements. It demonstrates a complete ML pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and selection.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and also available on Kaggle.

Features:

Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age

Target:
Outcome: 1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes
